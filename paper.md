# Abstract

Source separation models either work on the spectrogram or waveform domain.
In this work, we show how to perform end-to-end hybrid source separation,
letting the model decide which domain is best suited for each source, and even combining
both prediction. We propose a hybrid version of the Demucs architecture [@defossez2019music]
which won the Music Demixing Challenge 2021 organized by Sony.
This architecture also comes with additional improvements, such as compressed residual branches,
local attention or singular value regularization.
Overall, a 1.5dB improvement of the Signal-To-Distortion (SDR) was observed across all sources,
an improvement confirmed by human subjective evaluation, with an overall quality
rated at 2.83 out of 5, and absence of contamination at 3.04 (against 2.86 and 2.44
for the second ranking model submitted at the competition).
